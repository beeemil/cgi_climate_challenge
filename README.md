# My take on the CGI climate map challenge.
## Things I changed
- Updated packages
- Fixed the coordinates, changed lat with lon
- Changed marker icons
- Calculated a temperature average for the week for each station
- Also calculated daily accumulated rain and average temperature for each station
- Visualized these in a weather graph popup (removed sidebar)
